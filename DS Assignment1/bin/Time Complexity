By hashing we can sort the elements such that the time complexity for search is reduced. 
It is stored as key value pairs and we need to look for the key.
For direct addressing, the time complexity of add and find is O(1) since the array index is in direct relation with the key. 

Bloom filter basically has add function and search function.
In bloom filter we can store 0 or 1 and initially bloom filters are set to 0.
It return either true or false.
Bloom filters are compressed data structure. It takes less memory.
The time complexity of bloom filter is O(k) where k is the number of hash functions which is independent of the number of items 
present in the array.
